# obamabot

while setting up this repo i almost accidentally deleted everything so :)

obama is a discord bot i decided to make, he can do lotsa cool things such as:

-manage a starboard

-react to your messages with images or text

-manage self-assignable roles (kind of? i sorta half-assed it)

-produce random numbers from a dice formula, supporting modifiers and multiple types of dice at once\! 

-make me feel good about myself

this is an ongoing personal project of mine, im an amatuer for sure. i will add more features when i feel like it.  there is basically no documentation or comments because i am a lazy piece of shit. most of the skills used in this project were gained from google, looking at docs, trial and error, and asking people for help.

my discord is Satan.png \#9600 hmu if you have any questions, suggestions, or requests. i'm open for any ideas you wanna throw at me and you can totally have obama in your server :)

pls dont yoink without crediting me cuz theres like copyright and stuff and also thats just a dick move
